# 🌐 Cloud & SRE Portfolio – Nidhi Kumari

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This space showcases a collection of small scripts, tools, and projects I've built while exploring the world of **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** and **Cloud Computing**. Each project reflects a real-world problem I've tried to solve with simple, functional, and effective code.

I'm Nidhi Kumari, a passionate engineer focused on **infrastructure reliability**, **automation**, and **cloud-native technologies**. This repo serves both as my **learning playground** and a **demonstration of my journey** through the SRE/DevOps/Cloud ecosystem.
